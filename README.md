# _Ping Pong_

#### _A number changer, 1-22-16_

#### By _**Cory Meyers**_

## Description

_I created a webpage where a user inputs a number, and the page returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Start at index.html, and enter a number. A string of numbers and words will then be populated.

## Known Bugs

_No known bugs._

## Support and contact details

_Feel free to contact me should you encounter any issues with the program._

## Technologies Used

I built this site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
